# Surfs Up! Temperature Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to determine temperature trends in Oahu during the hottest and coldest days of the year in order to determine whether or not having a surf-and-ice-cream shop open year-round is a feasible decision. The reigning logic is, if the weather is noticeably different between June and December, the months containing the summer and winter solstices, respectively, then it might not be worthwhile to keep the surf shop open year-round.
